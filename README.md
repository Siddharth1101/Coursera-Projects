# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X Ray using PyTorch

Image classification of Chest X Rays in one of three classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, COVID-19

Dataset from [COVID-19 Radiography Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) on Kaggle

The model architecture used is a ResNet-18 from the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf">Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition</a> which is already an inbuilt Neural Network structure in Pytorch. Accuracy achieved is over 96%.
